# USB-Office-Finder-App
The School of Computer Science has recently moved into the new Urban Sciences Building which means that all staff are now in different offices. This is a simple Android application that will help users to navigate around Newcastle University's Urban Sciences Building.

This app was built using Android Studio, Java and SQL collaboratively as a team project.
